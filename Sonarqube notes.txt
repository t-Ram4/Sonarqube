Sonarqube

What is SonarQube?
SonarQube is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. 

Sonarqube is used to find the following issues in the code

1. Unused variables
2.Duplicate code
3.Use of System.out.println in the place of logger
4. Code vulnerable to throw NullPointerException


What is static code analysis ?
Computer code that is performed without actually executing programs.  Source code will be checked for compliance with a predefined set of rules or best practices set by the organization.


Quality Gate:

They are set of conditions that your code must meet in order to pass.

Example: code coverage should be 80%


Rule:
We can set rules in the Sonarqube, and our code will be checked against these rules.

Code smell:
When a piece of code does not comply with a rule, an issue is logged and they are called code smell.

Code Coverage
The amount of code covered by unit testcases is called code coverage
